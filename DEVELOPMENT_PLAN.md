   - Domain Models (pure Kotlin data classes)
   - Repository Interfaces

3. **Data Layer**
   - Repositories (implementation)
   - Data Sources (local database, file storage)
   - Data Models (entities, DTOs)

### Key Components
- **Screens**: Compose UI screens for different features
- **ViewModels**: Manage UI state and handle user interactions

3. **Trip**
   - id: Long (Primary Key)
   - name: String
   - description: String (nullable)
   - startDate: Date (nullable)
   - endDate: Date (nullable)
   - createdAt: Date

4. **Budget**
   - id: Long (Primary Key)
   - amount: BigDecimal
