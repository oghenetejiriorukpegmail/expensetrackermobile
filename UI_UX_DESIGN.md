# ExpenseTrackerMobile - UI/UX Design

This document outlines the user interface design principles, screen layouts, and user flows for the ExpenseTrackerMobile Android application.

## 1. Design Principles

### Material Design 3

The application will follow Material Design 3 guidelines, leveraging the latest components and patterns to create a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience.

Key Material Design 3 principles to implement:
- Dynamic color system
- Elevation and shadows
- Rounded corners
- Typography hierarchy
- Motion and animations
- Adaptive layouts

### Design Goals

1. **Intuitive**: Users should be able to navigate and use the app without extensive learning
2. **Efficient**: Minimize the number of steps required to complete common tasks
3. **Consistent**: Maintain consistent visual language and interaction patterns
4. **Responsive**: Adapt to different screen sizes and orientations
5. **Accessible**: Support accessibility features and follow best practices
6. **Delightful**: Include thoughtful animations and micro-interactions

### Color System

The app will implement a dynamic color system based on Material Design 3:

- **Primary**: Main brand color, used for key components and actions
- **Secondary**: Complementary color for less prominent elements
- **Tertiary**: Additional accent color for specific UI elements
- **Error**: Used for error states and critical actions
- **Background**: Surface colors for different elevation levels
- **On-colors**: Text and icon colors that provide sufficient contrast

The app will support both light and dark themes, with colors adapting appropriately for each theme.

### Typography

The typography system will use the default Roboto font family with the following hierarchy:

- **Display**: Large, prominent text for major headings
- **Headline**: Section headings and important text
- **Title**: Component headings and medium-emphasis text
- **Body**: Primary reading text
- **Label**: Small text for labels and annotations

- Use Material Design icons for consistency
- Implement custom icons for specific features where needed
- Ensure icons are recognizable and meaningful
- Maintain consistent sizing and styling
